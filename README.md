AI-Powered Smart Logging: Users instantly log e-waste by uploading an image or text. A fine-tuned AI model immediately categorizes the item as Recyclable, Reusable, or Hazardous, streamlining the first step of responsible disposal. (SDG 12)

 LLM-Generated Disposal Guidance: Following categorization, an LLM generates clear, human-friendly disposal and safety instructions (e.g., "Please remove the battery before disposal"), ensuring users handle items correctly from the start. (SDG 4, 12) 

Immutable Tracking with QR & Blockchain: Each item is tagged with a unique QR code linked to a blockchain ledger. This provides an unchangeable, end-to-end audit trail for every item, guaranteeing transparent and accountable processing. (SDG 9) 

Low-Carbon Logistics & Scheduling: An LLM based chatbot that schedules  pickup using natural language to nearest vendors available and sends them notification via whatsApp and notifies one hour prior to pickup time (SDG 11,13)

 Automated Compliance Reporting: The system leverages the verified data from the blockchain to auto-generate comprehensive, CPCB-compliant reports, saving administrative time and ensuring institutions effortlessly meet regulatory requirements. (SDG 16)

 Gamified Engagement Platform: A dedicated dashboard promotes user participation through gamification, including "Green Points" and leaderboards. This fosters a campus-wide culture of sustainability and friendly competition. (SDG 4, 11)
